# C-V2X Interoperability Testing Tool

This repository contains a set of semi-automated Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) interoperability testing
tools developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) IoT Devices Interoperability testbed.
This software is written in Python and can be used to automatically test C-V2X communication and interoperability,
and collect C-V2X packet traces from commercial On-Board Units (OBUs) and Road-Side Units (RSUs) based on the IEEE
1609.2, IEEE 1609.3, and SAE J2735 standards to assess the interoperability of C-V2X devices.
