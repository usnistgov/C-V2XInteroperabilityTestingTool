# C-V2X Interoperability Testing Software Tool

This repository contains a set of automated Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) interoperability testing software tools that include C-V2X interoperability testing procedures developed at the National Institute of Standrds and Technology (NIST) IoT Devices Interoperability testbed using Python. These software testing tools can be used to automatically test C-V2X communication and interoperability and collet C-V2X communication packet datsets among commercial on-board units (OBUs) and road-side units (RSUs) based on IEEE 1609.2, IEEE 1609.3, and SAE J2735 standards to achieve and assure IoT devices interoperability.
